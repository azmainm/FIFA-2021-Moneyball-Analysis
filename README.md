# FIFA-2021-Moneyball-Analysis
This notebook is a prescriptive analysis work performed on microsoft excel. I used a dataset that contains player data from FIFA21. The objective of the project was to find the best players for a team in the UCL (career mode) with a low budget and needs some new players. The project was inspired from the movie 'Moneyball'.
